# Member 1 — User & Authentication Module  
## ChronoCampus: Smart Time-Aware University Infrastructure System

This branch contains the development work for **Member 1**, responsible for building the **User and Authentication Module** of the ChronoCampus system.

The goal of this module is to provide secure user management, login sessions, and role-based access control for students, staff, and administrators.


##  Responsibilities (Member 1 Role)

This module handles:

- User registration and profile management
- Secure login and logout functionality
- Session handling using Flask
- Role-based access control (Student / Staff / Admin)
- Authentication APIs for frontend integration

This is the **core security layer** of the ChronoCampus platform.

##  Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python
- Flask Framework
- Session-based authentication
- REST API design

### Frontend

- CSS
- JavaScript

### Database
- PostgreSQL (planned integration)


##  Authentication Features (Planned)

- Login / Logout system
- Secure session management
- Role-based authorization
- JSON API responses for frontend
- Protected routes


##  Architecture Approach

This module follows a **Layered / MVC-based architecture**:

- Models → user data structure
- Routes → authentication endpoints
- Views → frontend login & profile pages
- Sessions → manage logged-in users


##  How to Run (Development Setup)

Full setup steps are documented inside:

docs/setup_guide.md

**General workflow (to be expanded later):**

1. Clone repository  
2. Navigate to backend folder  
3. Create virtual environment  
4. Install dependencies  
5. Run Flask server
